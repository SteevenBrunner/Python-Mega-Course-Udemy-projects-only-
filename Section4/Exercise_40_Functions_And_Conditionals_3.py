# Instructions :
# In one of the previous exercises you created a function that converted Celsius degrees to Fahrenheit:
# def cel_to_fahr(c):
#     f = c * 9/5 + 32
#     return f
# Now, the lowest possible temperature that physical matter can reach is -273.15 °C.
# With that in mind, please improve the function by making it print out a message
# in case a number lower than -273.15 is passed as input when calling the function.


def cel_to_fahr(c):
    if c < -273.15:
        return "Temperature given is too low"
    else:
        f = c * 9/5 + 32
        return f

print(cel_to_fahr(-270))
print(cel_to_fahr(-275))
